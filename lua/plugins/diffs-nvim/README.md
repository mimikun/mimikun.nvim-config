**Treesitter-powered Diff Syntax highlighting for Neovim**

Enhance Neovim's built-in diff mode (and much more!) with language-aware syntax
highlighting driven by treesitter.

## Features

- Treesitter syntax highlighting in
  [vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive),
  [Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit), builtin `diff` filetype, and
  more!
- Word and chatacer-level diff highlighting
- `:Diff` for [pierre-style](https://diffs.com) unified, stacked, or split diffs against any revision
- `:Diff review` full-repo review diff with qflist/loclist navigation
- `:Diff files {a} {b}` to diff two arbitrary files
- Inline and 3-way merge conflict detection, highlighting, and resolution
- Email quoting/patch syntax support (`> diff ...`)
- Vim syntax fallback
- [Difftastic](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/) highlight support
- Configurable highlighting

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.9.0+
- Optional: the Treesitter `diff` parser for the best experience

## Installation

With `vim.pack` (Neovim 0.12+):

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  'https://github.com/barrettruth/diffs.nvim',
})
```

Or via [luarocks](https://luarocks.org/modules/barrettruth/diffs.nvim):

```
luarocks install diffs.nvim
```

## Documentation

```vim
:help diffs.nvim
```

## FAQ

**Q: Does diffs.nvim support
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)/[Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit)/[neojj](https://github.com/NicholasZolton/neojj)/[gitsigns](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim)/[fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua)?**

Yes. Enable integrations in your config:

```lua
vim.g.diffs = {
  integrations = {
    fugitive = true,
    neogit = true,
    neojj = true,
    gitsigns = true,
  }
}
```

fzf-lua is supported out-of-the-box.

See the documentation for more information.

**Q: Can I use diffs.nvim as a Git mergetool?**

Yes. Configure Git to open `$MERGED` with Neovim; diffs.nvim will detect
conflict markers automatically. See `:help diffs.nvim-git-mergetool`.

**Q: Can I exclude untracked files from `:Diff review`?**

Yes. Run `:Diff review ++nountracked`. To make it the default, wrap it in your
own command, e.g. `:command! Review Diff review ++nountracked`.

## Known Limitations

- **Incomplete syntax context**: Treesitter parses each diff hunk in isolation.
  Context lines within the hunk provide syntactic context for the parser. With
  or without context, hunks that start or end mid-expression may produce imperfect
  highlights due to treesitter error recovery.

- **Syntax "flashing"**: `diffs.nvim` hooks into the `FileType fugitive` event
  triggered by `vim-fugitive`, at which point the buffer is preliminarily
  painted. The decoration provider applies highlights on the next redraw cycle,
  so a brief first-paint flash may still occur.

- **Cold Start**: Treesitter grammar loading (~10ms) and query compilation
  (~4ms) are one-time costs per language per Neovim session. Each language pays
  this cost on first encounter, which may cause a brief stutter when a diff
  containing a new language first enters the viewport.

- **Vim syntax fallback is deferred**: The vim syntax fallback (for languages
  without a treesitter parser) cannot run inside the decoration provider's
  redraw cycle due to Neovim's restriction on buffer mutations. Vim syntax
  highlights for cold hunks may appear one frame later. Warm hunks can reuse
  cached vim syntax spans, and stale deferred renders are ignored after buffer
  changes.

- **Conflicting diff plugins**: `diffs.nvim` may not interact well with other
  plugins that modify diff highlighting. Known plugins that may conflict:
  - [`diffview.nvim`](https://github.com/sindrets/diffview.nvim) - provides its
    own diff highlighting and conflict resolution UI
  - [`mini.diff`](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.diff) - visualizes buffer
    differences with its own highlighting system
  - [`gitsigns.nvim`](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim) - generally
    compatible, but both plugins modifying line highlights may produce
    unexpected results
  - [`git-conflict.nvim`](https://github.com/akinsho/git-conflict.nvim) -
    `diffs.nvim` now includes built-in conflict resolution; disable one or the
    other to avoid overlap
