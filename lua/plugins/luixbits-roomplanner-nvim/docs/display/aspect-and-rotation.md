# Aspect and rotation

Terminal character cells are usually taller than they are wide. RoomPlan
stores `canvas.cell_aspect` as **cell height divided by cell width** and uses it
to derive the world distance represented by a row. The default is `2.0`.

If a square room looks vertically stretched or compressed, run:

```vim
:RoomPlanAspect 2.0
```

Omit the argument to edit the current value through `vim.ui.input`. Calibration
is process-wide because every canvas shares the same terminal font geometry;
RoomPlan refits every live session after a change. It does not write your
configuration. Once satisfied, persist the value:

```lua
require("roomplan").setup({
  canvas = { cell_aspect = 2.0 },
})
```

Changing the font, line spacing, terminal, or GUI frontend may require a new
value. Use `:checkhealth roomplan` to see the effective calibration.

## Rotating the view

`Alt-l` rotates clockwise, `Alt-h` rotates counter-clockwise, and `g0` restores
the original plan view/up projection. The command form is:

```vim
:RoomPlanRotateView clockwise
:RoomPlanRotateView counterclockwise
:RoomPlanRotateView reset
```

Rotation affects only the canvas projection. It does not rotate Neovim's
windows, alter room/door/furniture coordinates, create history, or persist in
the plan. Before sunlight site setup, the compass displays plan up (`P↑`, `P→`,
`P↓`, or `P←`). After setup it displays the exact saved geographic-north angle
with eight arrow directions, such as `N↗`. Movement and pan keys remain
screen-relative. Wall choices and feedback likewise say top/right/bottom/left
for the current projection while their stable stored coordinates remain
unchanged.

Rotation occurs in 90-degree steps and preserves the world point under the
logical cursor when possible. Aspect calibration remains height/width of the
terminal cell; it does not swap when the view rotates.
