# Settings

Call `setup()` after RoomPlan is on `runtimepath`:

```lua
require("roomplan").setup({})
```

Every call starts from immutable defaults, validates the complete candidate,
then swaps it in. Unknown keys and wrong value types raise one grouped error
instead of becoming stale no-ops.

## Plan defaults and catalogues

```lua
plan_defaults = {
  metadata = { name = nil, notes = "" },
  settings = {
    grid_mm = 100,
    fine_step_mm = 10,
    normal_step_mm = 100,
    coarse_step_mm = 500,
    default_door_width_mm = 900,
  },
},
furniture = {
  include_builtins = true,
  definitions = {},
  files = {},
},
```

These plan defaults apply only when initializing a new source; they do not
rewrite opened plans. A `nil` name uses the schema's `Untitled plan`. Movement
steps and the grid are stored per plan and can later be edited by selecting the
plan row and pressing `e`. In `MOVE`, normal and coarse keys use the smallest
whole multiple of their configured step that spans at least one visible cell;
this prevents one border or label moving before the rest at a distant zoom.
Ctrl-direction fine movement always uses the exact configured fine step, even
when that is intentionally smaller than one cell. MOVE status reports the
actual distance chosen; `.` makes normal movement more granular by zooming in.
Furniture imports are covered in
[Furniture catalogues](../planning/furniture-catalogs.md).

## Safety and history limits

```lua
limits = {
  max_dimension_mm = 100000,
  max_abs_coordinate_mm = 1000000,
  max_plan_span_mm = 1000000,
  max_auto_place_distance_mm = 100000,
  max_history = 100,
  max_history_bytes_per_session = 64 * 1024 * 1024,
  max_history_bytes_global = 256 * 1024 * 1024,
},
```

The geometry limits produce validation errors; the auto-placement limit bounds
its search. History is bounded by both entry count and estimated retained
snapshot memory. Eviction preserves the current revision and may reduce the
available undo depth.

## Canvas and snapping

```lua
canvas = {
  open = "tab",                 -- "tab", "split", or "vsplit"
  unicode = "auto",             -- "auto", "unicode", or "ascii"
  mm_per_column = 100,
  cell_aspect = 2.0,             -- terminal cell height / width
  zoom_factor = 1.25,
  min_mm_per_column = 1,
  max_mm_per_column = 100000,
  fit_margin_cells = 2,
  header_lines = 1,
  scrolloff = 3,
  pan_step_cells = 5,
  pan_coarse_step_cells = 20,
  show_grid = false,
  detail_level = "middle",       -- "high", "middle", or "none"
  show_compass = true,
},
snapping = {
  enabled = true,
  tolerance_cells = 1.5,
  max_distance_mm = 250,
  priority = { "door", "room_edge", "room_center", "furniture", "grid" },
},
```

`mm_per_column` is the initial scale; Fit chooses a scale from the scene.
Snap tolerance starts in displayed cells and is capped by `max_distance_mm`.
The priority list resolves equal candidates in the order shown.

`scrolloff` follows Neovim's option name and keeps that many drawable canvas
cells between the logical cursor and every viewport edge while navigating with
`h/j/k/l`. At the margin, further movement pans the RoomPlan viewport instead
of trapping the cursor. The same behavior applies to coarse directions and
rotated views. Set it to `0` to wait until the cursor reaches the actual edge.
It is transient view state and never changes the plan or undo history.

Movement and resizing name the chosen snap target and highlight exact contact.
Press `gs` to disable magnetic snapping or `g!` to bypass the next change.
These guides are transient and never enter saved data. See [Canvas
controls](../workspace/canvas.md) for movement and [Rooms](../planning/rooms.md)
for footprint editing.

`detail_level` controls transient canvas text. `high` shows labels plus every
exterior wall-run, furniture width/depth, and door/window-width dimension.
`middle` (the default) shows labels plus exterior wall-run dimensions. `none`
renders geometry without labels or dimensions. Press `t`, use
`:RoomPlanCanvasDetail`, or call `require("roomplan").set_canvas_detail()` to
change the current session without changing its model or history. Within the
visible levels, names and dimensions have built-in projected-screen budgets:
they abbreviate or disappear as their objects shrink, so no additional zoom
threshold setting is required.

## Sun study defaults

```lua
sun_study = {
  window_defaults = {
    sill_height_mm = 900,
    head_height_mm = 2100,
  },
  playback = {
    step_minutes = 60,
    frame_duration_ms = 700,
  },
},
```

Window defaults are used only when a window has no explicit sill/head pair;
they are not copied into every plan object. The head must exceed the
non-negative sill. Playback defaults seed each new transient `S` popup. The
step may be 1–720 minutes and frame duration 50–60000 ms; the popup lets you
change both for the current study. The same minute step determines the sampling
resolution of the transient daily-exposure map. Sun colors adapt to the
colorscheme and do not add more configuration keys. See
[Sun study](../planning/sun-study.md).

## Workspace and notifications

```lua
ui = {
  confirm_delete = true,
  notify_level = "info",         -- "debug", "info", "warn", or "error"
  workspace = {
    layout = "auto",             -- "auto", "wide", "medium", or "compact"
    left_width = 26,
    right_width = 30,
    navigator_visible = true,
    details_visible = false,
    wide_min_columns = 120,
    compact_max_columns = 89,
    compact_min_rows = 22,
    min_canvas_width = 55,
    min_canvas_height = 10,
    footer_height = 1,
    cycle_tabs = true,
    ascii = false,
    border = "rounded",
  },
},
```

`layout = "auto"` selects the responsive rules documented in
[Workspace overview](../workspace/overview.md). A forced layout is useful for
testing but may be cramped. `border` accepts any border style supported by
`nvim_open_win`. Setting `footer_height = 0` removes the persistent action bar;
`?` and commands remain available.

## Autosave, mappings, and glyphs

```lua
autosave = {
  enabled = false,
  debounce_ms = 1000,
  norg = false,
},
keymaps = {
  enabled = true,
  mappings = {},
},
glyphs = nil,
```

Autosave runs only for an unchanged, conflict-free, layout-valid revision.
Norg requires explicit opt-in and an otherwise unmodified source buffer.
Mappings and custom glyph requirements have dedicated chapters:
[Keymaps](keymaps.md) and [Appearance](../display/appearance.md).
