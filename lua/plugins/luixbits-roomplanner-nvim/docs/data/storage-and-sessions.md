# Storage and sessions

RoomPlan supports two source adapters and keeps one writable live session per
source.

## Standalone JSON

Files ending in `.roomplan.json` contain one deterministic schema-v4 document.
Initialization refuses to overwrite non-empty content. Saving updates a loaded
source through Neovim's buffer and normal write hooks; a detached writer only
creates a new path atomically and never replaces an existing one.

## Norg notes

Files ending in `.norg` (or Norg buffers) store the same JSON in a marked block:

```norg
* Floor plan

@code json roomplan.nvim
{ "format": "roomplan.nvim", "schema_version": 4, "units": "mm", ... }
@end
```

RoomPlan replaces only the selected payload through buffer APIs, then performs
a normal write of the whole note. Unrelated unsaved note edits are therefore
preserved and written too. A conservative scanner rejects multiple marked
plans, malformed marked JSON, unterminated blocks, or ambiguous candidates
instead of guessing. Legacy unmarked JSON is readable only when its top-level
`format` clearly identifies RoomPlan; new writes use the marker.

Neorg and Tree-sitter are optional. Multiple `* Floor plan` headings require an
interactive choice before initialization.

## Older schema migration

Opening a valid schema-v1, schema-v2, or schema-v3 JSON/Norg payload migrates
its in-memory model sequentially to schema v4. The v2-to-v3 step adds empty
canonical `windows` and `outlets` collections; v3-to-v4 marks existing outlets
as wall-mounted. Loading does not modify the source buffer or disk file. The
session remains protected and autosave stays paused until an explicit save
accepts the schema rewrite; that save writes the deterministic v4
representation. Reload and conflict checks retain this protection instead of
treating semantic equality as a durable savepoint.

## Session lifecycle

- **Hide** (`q` or `:RoomPlanHide`) closes workspace windows but retains the
  model, semantic history, source ownership, and quit protection.
- **Open** on an already owned source focuses/recreates that workspace instead
  of creating a second session.
- **Close** (`:RoomPlanClose`) unloads the session. Protected state prompts;
  `:RoomPlanClose!` deliberately discards it.
- **Reload** rereads the source. Protected state prompts;
  `:RoomPlanReload!` deliberately discards it.

Commands normally resolve the session attached to the current source or
workspace buffer, then fall back when exactly one session exists. With several
unattached sessions, `:RoomPlan` lets you choose.

Undo and redo retain named semantic revisions within the configured history
limits. **Browse undo history** in `?` lists those retained entries newest-first,
distinguishes the current and durable saved revisions, and confirms before
moving to an older or newer snapshot. Restoring is transient until saved;
making a new edit from an older revision discards the newer redo branch.

## Conflicts and recovery

RoomPlan records expected buffer and disk revisions. If the source changes
outside its save transaction, saving stops with `CONFLICT`. It never silently
overwrites the newer source. `:RoomPlanResolveConflict` offers review, reload,
and Save As. It also offers a confirmed overwrite while the current payload is
still parseable and unchanged. A hidden `acwrite` guard keeps risky in-memory
state from being discarded by an ordinary quit. If saving that guard finds a
conflict, it keeps the session modified and opens the same resolution choices.

Autosave is off by default, runs only after the debounce and clean validation,
and pauses on conflicts. Norg autosave requires both `autosave.enabled = true`
and `autosave.norg = true`, and never runs over unrelated modified note text.
