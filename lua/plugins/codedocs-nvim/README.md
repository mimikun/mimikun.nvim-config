## Usage

### Generate an annotation

An annotation insertion can be triggered using the `:Codedocs` command. There are
two ways to use the command:

- **Without arguments**: The plugin attempts to detect the code target under
  the cursor, determines the default style for the current file’s language, and
  applies the corresponding annotation. If no target is recognized under the
  cursor, an inline comment is inserted. By default, a matching annotation exists
  for each target unless you’ve customized the configuration.

- **With an annotation name**: You can pass the name of any annotation definition
  defined in the language’s default style. The plugin will generate and insert the
  annotation using that definition.

For a more convenient experience, you can bind the command to a keymap. For example:

```lua
vim.keymap.set(
    "n", "<leader>k", "<cmd>Codedocs<CR>",
    { desc = "Insert annotation" }
)
```

### Delete an annotation

Although it is not actually a Codedocs feature but a Neovim one, you should know
that any comment can be deleted by placing your cursor on it and pressing `dgc`.

### Lua API

> [!TIP]
> You can check the function signatures using a LSP such as [LuaLS](https://luals.github.io/)

A Lua API is provided in case you find any of the already existing functionality
useful. The API can be accessed by requiring the `codedocs` module:

```lua
local Codedocs = require("codedocs")
```

The following functions are available:

- `generate`: Triggers an annotation generation (it's what `:Codedocs` uses under
  the hood)

## Configuration

All options can be customized using the setup function. Here are most of the
default options:

```lua
require("codedocs").setup {
    debug = false,
    languages = {
        --- This table is too big to be displayed here
        --- The path to the config file is `codedocs/config/init.lua`
    },
    aliases = {
        sh = "bash"
    }
}
```

### Change a language's default style

Default styles are defined using the `default_style` key. For example, let's set
the default styles for Python and Lua:

```lua
require("codedocs").setup {
    languages = {
        python = {
            default_style =  "reST"
        },
        lua = {
            default_style = "EmmyLua"
        }
    },
}
```

### How annotations work

> [!CAUTION]
> All annotations are expected to include all the options, using any of the valid
> values, for the plugin to work properly

An annotation is a regular Lua table that can interact with code items,
and with some options (keys).

#### Items

An item is a unit of data that can be extracted from code structures such as functions,
classes, and similar constructs. In the context of the plugin, a code structure
from which items are extracted is referred to as a `target`.

Ultimately, an item is a table with a `name` and `type` keys.

For example, the following function:

```python
def foo(a: int, b: string) -> int:
    ...
```

has the following items:

```lua
{
    parameters = { -- List of parameter items
        {
            name = "a",
            type = "int"
        },
        {
            name = "b",
            type = "string"
        },
    },
    returns = {
        {
            name = "",
            type = "int"
        }
    }
}
```

Since the plugin relies on Treesitter for extraction, a target is identified by
one or more Treesitter node types.

For example, this is what the `targets` key of the default Lua configuration looks
like:

```lua
local default_config = {
    languages = {
        lua = {
            default_style = "EmmyLua",
            styles = {
                --Style/annotation data
            },
            targets = {
                func = {
                    node_identifiers = { ---Determines what Treesitter node types identify the target
                        "function_definition",
                        "function_declaration",
                    },
                    extractors = {
                        parameters = function()
                            ---Some logic that eventually returns a list of items
                        end,
                        returns = function()
                            ---Some logic that eventually returns a list of items
                        end
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

When the target is processed the result is a table where each key corresponds to
one of the keys under `extractors`, and the values are the list of items returned
by each function.

#### Options

| Option Name         | Expected Value Type                                 | Behavior                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `relative_position` | `"above"` \| `"below"` \| `"empty_target_or_above"` | Where to insert the annotation                    |
| `indented`          | boolean                                             | Whether to indent the entire annotation one level |
| `blocks`            | table (list)                                        | List of blocks forming the annotation             |

Blocks are the core of an annotation, they determine what it ultimately looks
like.

##### Blocks

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `blocks` option is a list, so you cannot override a single block on its
> own. Because your config is merged recursively with the defaults, any blocks
> you do not explicitly include will be removed, even if they exist in the defaults.
>
> To customize just one block, copy the default `blocks` list and modify the
> specific block you want.

| Option Name          | Expected Type | Behavior                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `name`               | string        | The name of the block, useful for readability and for items  |
| `layout`             | string[]      | List of lines that that make up the block                    |
| `insert_gap_between` | table         | Sets up a gap in between the current block/item and the next |
| `ignore_prev_gap`    | boolean       | Skips the gap defined by the previous block (if enabled)     |
| `items`              | table?        | Sets up options for the block's items                        |

All options with the exception of `ignore_prev_gap` have some caveats that will
be explained below in detail.

###### `layout` option

> [!INFO]
> The layout lines of all blocks are concatenated in block order to form the
> final annotation.

The following string placeholders are predefined:

- `%snippet_tabstop_index`: Inserts a tabstop index for defining snippet tabstops
  (e.g., `$%snippet_tabstop_index` or `${%snippet_tabstop_index:default label}`).
- `%>`: Either a tab character or a number of spaces, based on your Neovim settings

###### `insert_gap_between` option

The following suboptions are available:

| Name    | Expected Value Type | Behavior                                                 |
| ------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled | `boolean`           | Whether a gap is inserted in between two blocks or items |
| text    | `string`            | String used as the gap                                   |

###### `name` and `items` option

The `name` option serves two main purposes:

1. It identifies the block, making its role easier to understand
2. It links the block to a specific group of items extracted from a target

The second purpose only applies to item-based blocks. When items are extracted
from a target, they are grouped by block name. For a block to access those items,
its `name` must match the corresponding group in the target.

For example, given a target called `func` with the following items table:

```lua
local items = {
    parameters = {
        {
            name = "a",
            type = "string"
        },
        {
            name = "b",
            type = "int"
        }
    },
    returns = {
        {
            name = "",
            type = "int"
        }
    }
}
```

If the annotation to be generated is also named `func` these items become available
for use. Any block whose `name` matches a key in the items table, such as `parameters`
or `returns` in the example, can access the corresponding items. This is done through
the `items` option, which supports options like
`insert_gap_between` and `layout`.

In this context, the `layout` defines how each individual item is rendered, and
its output is appended to the block’s own `layout`. Additionally, the default `layout`
placeholders are expanded with the following ones:

- `%item_name`
- `%item_type`

When used, they get replaced by the item's name and type respectively.

The following target blocks are available:

| target  | blocks                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| `func`  | `title`, `parameters`, `returns` |
| `class` | `title`, `attributes`            |

### Customize an annotation

You can customize almost (for now!) every aspect of an annotation. Whether you
want to make a simple change, like modifying the characters wrapping the parameter
type:

```python
def cool_function_with_type_hints(a: int, b: bool) -> str:
    """
    <title goes here>

    Args:
        a <int>:
        b <bool>:
    Returns:
        str:
    """
    self.sum = 1 + 1
    return <value>
```

Or if you want to go all out with customization:

```python
def cool_function_with_type_hints(a: int, b: bool) -> str:
        """
        <title goes here>

        Some cool customized title!:
            a (づ ◕‿◕ )づ int ⊂(´• ω •`⊂):

            b (づ ◕‿◕ )づ bool ⊂(´• ω •`⊂):
        This is some return type...:
            (￢_￢;) str:
        """
        self.sum = 1 + 1
        return <value>
```

In this case, we:

- Increased spacing between items in the parameters block.
- Wrapped parameter types with two [Kaomojis](https://kaomoji.ru/en/).
- Added a third kaomoji to wrap the left side of the return type.
- Customized the titles for both the parameters and return blocks.

The [How annotations work](#how-annotations-work) section covers everything you
need to know about annotations. Since all built-in annotations are implemented this
way, you can customize them using the same principles.

With that in mind, suppose we want to make the following changes to the `func` annotation
for Python's Google style:

- Add a gap in between parameters.
- Add a gap in between blocks

As mentioned earlier, the blocks option is a list, so you can’t override a single
block in isolation; you have to redefine the entire list. That’s fine if you
intend to change the whole annotation, but if you only need to adjust one block,
it’s better to copy the annotation and modify only the blocks you need.

```lua
local original_blocks_list = require("codedocs.config").languages.python.styles.Google.func.blocks
local new_func_blocks = vim.deepcopy(original_blocks_list) -- We copy the original annotation blocks list
print(vim.inspect(new_func_blocks)) -- It's helpful to print the list to check what it looks like before modifying it

local second_block = new_func_blocks[2] -- In this specific case the second block is the parameters one
second_block.items.insert_gap_between.enabled = true -- We enable the insertion of a gap in between items (parameters in this case)

for _, block in ipairs(new_func_blocks) do -- We iterate over each block
    block.insert_gap_between.enabled = true -- We enable the insertion of a gap in between the current block and the next
end

require("codedocs").setup({
    languages = {
        python = {
            styles = {
                Google = {
                    func = { -- The func annotation key
                        blocks = new_func_blocks -- We assign the new list which will replace the default one
                    }
                },
            },
        },
    }
})
```

### Add a new language

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the [How annotations work](#how-annotations-work) section to understand
> how annotations work, how they are defined, and their relationship with the
> `targets` key.

To add support for a new language, simply add a key under `languages` with the name
of that language. For example, to add support for `Cobol` with a default style called
`cobolito`:

```lua
require("codedocs").setup {
    languages = {
        cobol = {
            default_style = "cobolito",
            styles = {
                cobolito = {
                    --The annotations contained in the `cobolito` style should be defined  here
                }
            },
            targets = {
                --The target definitions
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Add a new annotation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Check the [How annotations work](#how-annotations-work) section to see what
> annotation options are available and how they work

To add a new annotation for an existing language, simply add the annotation name
as a key under the desired style. The value of that key should be a table containing
the annotation options.

For example, to add a new annotation called `deprecated` under the EmmyLua style
in Lua:

```lua
require("codedocs").setup {
    languages = {
        lua = {
            styles = {
                EmmyLua = {
                    deprecated = {
                        --Annotation options go here
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
