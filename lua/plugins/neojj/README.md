![CleanShot 2026-03-08 at 17 10 07](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/02ac2b11-41a2-48a1-8fe0-0eb013cfd6a1)

Neojj is a hard fork of [Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit), adapted to work with [jj (Jujutsu VCS)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) instead of git.

**Maintainer:** [Nicholas Zolton](https://github.com/nicholaszolton)

> **Note:** Some features (specifically diffview and codediff integration) currently require a [git-colocated repository](https://jj-vcs.github.io/jj/latest/git-compatibility/#co-located-jujutsugit-repos). Work is underway to remove this dependency.

## Installation

Requires [jj (Jujutsu VCS)](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) to be installed and available on your `PATH`.

Here's an example spec for [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim), but you're free to use whichever plugin manager suits you.

```lua
{
  "NicholasZolton/neojj",
  version = "^1.0.0", -- recommended: track 1.x releases (see Versioning below)
  lazy = true,
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",         -- required

    -- Only one of these is needed.
    "sindrets/diffview.nvim",        -- optional
    "esmuellert/codediff.nvim",      -- optional

    -- Only one of these is needed.
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim", -- optional
    "ibhagwan/fzf-lua",              -- optional
    "nvim-mini/mini.pick",           -- optional
    "folke/snacks.nvim",             -- optional
  },
  cmd = "Neojj",
  keys = {
    { "<leader>gg", "<cmd>Neojj<cr>", desc = "Show Neojj UI" }
  }
}
```

### Versioning

NeoJJ follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org): breaking changes only
land in major releases. With `version = "^1.0.0"`, lazy.nvim installs the
latest `1.x` tag — you get new features and fixes on `:Lazy update`, but a
breaking `2.0` requires you to bump the pin yourself. Drop the `version` line
to track `main` directly (bleeding edge, may break without warning). Each
release is documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage

You can either open Neojj by using the `Neojj` command:

```vim
:Neojj             " Open the status buffer in a new tab
:Neojj cwd=<cwd>   " Use a different repository path
:Neojj cwd=%:p:h   " Uses the repository of the current file
:Neojj kind=<kind> " Open specified popup directly
:Neojj commit      " Open commit popup
:Neojj bookmark    " Open bookmark popup
:Neojj workspace   " Open workspace popup

" Map it to a key
nnoremap <leader>gg <cmd>Neojj<cr>
```

```lua
-- Or via lua api
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gg", "<cmd>Neojj<cr>", { desc = "Open Neojj UI" })
```

Or using the lua api:

```lua
local neojj = require('neojj')

-- open using defaults
neojj.open()

-- open a specific popup
neojj.open({ "commit" })

-- open as a split
neojj.open({ kind = "split" })

-- open with different project
neojj.open({ cwd = "~" })

-- You can map this to a key
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>gg", neojj.open, { desc = "Open Neojj UI" })

-- Wrap in a function to pass additional arguments
vim.keymap.set(
    "n",
    "<leader>gg",
    function() neojj.open({ kind = "split" }) end,
    { desc = "Open Neojj UI" }
)
```

The `kind` option can be one of the following values:
- `tab`      (default)
- `replace`
- `split`
- `split_above`
- `split_above_all`
- `split_below`
- `split_below_all`
- `vsplit`
- `floating`
- `auto` (`vsplit` if window would have 80 cols, otherwise `split`)

## jj Concepts

If you are coming from git, here are some key differences in jj:

- **Change IDs vs Commit IDs**: Every change has a unique change ID (short, stable identifier) and a commit ID (hash). Change IDs persist across rewrites; commit IDs do not.
- **No staging area**: There is no index/staging concept. All modifications in your working copy are automatically part of the current change.
- **Bookmarks instead of branches**: jj uses "bookmarks" where git uses "branches". Bookmarks are pointers to commits, similar to git branches.
- **Operations log and undo**: Every jj operation is recorded. You can undo any operation with `jj undo`.
- **First-class conflicts**: Conflicts are recorded in commits rather than blocking operations. You can continue working and resolve them later.

## Configuration

You can configure Neojj by running the `require('neojj').setup {}` function, passing a table as the argument.

## Popups

The following popup menus are available from the status buffer (press `?` for the help popup to see all keybindings):

| Key | Popup | Description |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| `?` | **Help** | Show available keybindings |
| `b` | **Bookmark** | Create, move, delete, forget, rename, track/untrack bookmarks. Move bookmark to another bookmark. |
| `c` | **Change** | Commit, new change, new on revision/bookmark, new before, describe, edit, abandon, duplicate, revert. Uppercase variants move bookmarks forward. |
| `d` | **Diff** | View diffs (working copy, range, trunk to working copy, specific change, diffedit) |
| `f` | **Fetch** | Fetch from remotes |
| `l` | **Log** | View log with revset support |
| `m` | **Remote** | Add, remove, rename remotes |
| `p` | **Push** | Push bookmarks to remotes |
| `r` | **Rebase** | Rebase changes (single, range, onto revision) |
| `s` | **Squash** | Squash changes into parent |
| `u` | **Undo** | Undo/redo jj operations |
| `w` | **Workspace** | Add, delete, forget, rename, list workspaces. Quick-add to worktrees directory. |

Many popups will use whatever is currently under the cursor or selected as input for an action. For example, to rebase a range of changes from the log view, a linewise visual selection can be made, and the rebase action will apply to that selection.

## Status Buffer

The status buffer shows:

- **Change / Parent** headers with change ID, commit ID, bookmarks (highlighted), and description
- **Conflicts** section (if any unresolved conflicts exist)
- **Modified files** with inline diff support (toggle with `<tab>`)
- **Recent Changes** showing ancestor commits
- **Bookmarks** section with local and remote bookmarks (unpushed bookmarks marked with `*`)

### Context Actions

These keybindings work directly in the status buffer on whatever is under your cursor (a commit in Recent Changes, a bookmark, etc.):

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `D` | **Describe** | Edit the description of the change under cursor |
| `E` | **Edit** | Switch your working copy to the change under cursor |
| `O` | **New change on** | Create a new change on top of the revision under cursor |
| `B` | **New change before** | Insert a new change before the revision under cursor |
| `F` | **Forget bookmark** | Forget the bookmark under cursor (or track a remote bookmark) |
| `o` | **Open in browser** | Open the line under cursor on GitHub/GitLab: the repo on the project header, the open PR on a line annotated with one, otherwise the commit |
| `x` | **Discard / Abandon** | Discard file changes, abandon the change (or divergent variant) under cursor, or delete a bookmark under cursor |

> [!NOTE]
> **Keybind convention:** lowercase keys open popups and pickers; capital letters are contextual
> actions that act on whatever is under the cursor.
>
> **Migrating from older versions:** the Squash, Workspace, Push, and Remote popups moved from
> `S`/`W`/`P`/`M` to `s`/`w`/`p`/`m`. The `A` (abandon current change) and `N` (new change)
> bindings were removed — use `x` to abandon the change under the cursor, `c a` to abandon via
> picker, and `c n` / `O` / `B` to create new changes. Custom `mappings.popup` configs are
> unaffected.

## Common Workflows

### For git users: how jj maps to what you know

<details>
<summary><strong>Checking out a PR / someone else's branch</strong></summary>

In git you'd run `git fetch && git checkout feature-branch`. In jj, bookmarks are the equivalent of branches:

1. Press `f` to open the **Fetch** popup, then `f` to fetch all remotes
2. The remote bookmark will appear in the **Bookmarks** section (shown as `name@origin`)
3. Move your cursor to the remote bookmark and press `O` to create a new change on top of it — Neojj automatically tracks the remote bookmark for you

Alternatively, from the **Change** popup (`c`):
- Press `p` to pick a bookmark from a fuzzy finder and create a new change on it
- Press `o` to pick any revision from a fuzzy finder

**CLI equivalent:** `jj git fetch && jj bookmark track <name>@origin && jj new <bookmark-name>`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Creating a PR / pushing a branch</strong></summary>

In git you'd create a branch, commit, and push. In jj:

1. Make your changes — they're automatically part of the current change (no staging needed)
2. Press `c` then `c` to **commit** (opens an editor for the description), or `c` then `D` to describe inline
3. Open the **Bookmark** popup with `b`, then `c` to **create** a bookmark on your change
4. Press `p` to open the **Push** popup and push the bookmark

To keep working after committing, press `c` then `n` to create a **new change** on top.

If you want bookmarks to automatically follow your new changes, use the uppercase variants: `c` then `C` (commit + move bookmarks) or `c` then `N` (new change + move bookmarks).

**CLI equivalent:** `jj commit -m "msg" && jj bookmark create my-branch && jj git push --bookmark my-branch`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Stashing changes</strong></summary>

You don't need to stash in jj. Every change is automatically its own "stash." To set aside current work:

1. Press `c` then `n` to create a **new change** — your previous work stays in the parent change
2. Do whatever you need to do
3. Press `c` then `e` to **edit** back to your original change when you're ready to resume

Since there's no staging area, your working copy changes are always safely captured.

**CLI equivalent:** `jj new` (to set aside) then `jj edit <change-id>` (to resume)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Rebasing onto latest main</strong></summary>

In git you'd run `git rebase main`. In jj:

1. Press `ff` to **fetch** the latest changes
2. Press `r` to open the **Rebase** popup
3. Press `h` to rebase **here (@) onto** a selected revision, or `t` to rebase the whole **stack onto trunk**

If you have a chain of changes, use `s` in the rebase popup to rebase a **source** and all its descendants.

**CLI equivalent:** `jj git fetch && jj rebase -d main`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Resolving merge conflicts</strong></summary>

In jj, conflicts don't block operations — they're recorded in the commit. You can resolve them whenever you want:

1. Conflicts appear in the **Conflicts** section of the status buffer
2. Edit the conflicted files directly — jj uses conflict markers similar to git
3. Once resolved, the conflict markers disappear from the status buffer on next refresh

**CLI equivalent:** `jj resolve` (to use a merge tool) or edit files directly

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Cherry-picking a commit</strong></summary>

In jj, the equivalent of cherry-pick is "duplicate":

1. Press `c` to open the **Change** popup
2. Press `u` to **duplicate** — pick a change from the fuzzy finder
3. The duplicated change appears as a new change with the same content

**CLI equivalent:** `jj duplicate <change-id>`

</details>

### Neojj workflows

<details>
<summary><strong>Creating a change on top of a bookmark or revision</strong></summary>

**Quickest way (from status buffer):** Move your cursor to a commit in **Recent Changes** or a bookmark in the **Bookmarks** section, then press `O`. This creates a new change directly on top of that revision.

**From the Change popup (`c`):**
- `o` — pick any revision from a fuzzy finder
- `O` — same, but also moves bookmarks forward
- `p` — pick a bookmark from a fuzzy finder
- `P` — same, but also moves bookmarks forward

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Inserting a change before an existing one</strong></summary>

Sometimes you need to insert a fix before an existing change rather than on top of it.

**From status buffer:** Move your cursor to the target revision and press `B`.

**From the Change popup (`c`):** Press `b` to pick a revision from a fuzzy finder.

This runs `jj new --insert-before`, which creates a new change whose child is the target revision.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Moving bookmarks with your changes</strong></summary>

When you create new changes with `c` then `n`, bookmarks stay on the old change. If you want bookmarks to follow along:

- `c` then `N` — new change + move bookmarks forward
- `c` then `C` — commit + move bookmarks forward
- `c` then `O` — new change on revision + move bookmarks forward
- `c` then `P` — new change on bookmark + move bookmarks forward

The uppercase variants move any bookmarks that were on the old `@` to the new `@`, and bookmarks from the old `@-` to the new `@-`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Splitting and squashing changes</strong></summary>

**Splitting**: Use `jj split` from the command line to break a change into two. Neojj will support this in a future release.

**Squashing** (`s` popup): Merge changes together.
- `s` — squash the current change into its parent
- `S` — squash into a specific revision (picked from fuzzy finder)
- `a` — absorb changes into prior commits automatically

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Navigating and editing historical changes</strong></summary>

In jj, you can edit any change in your history, not just the latest one:

1. In the **Recent Changes** section, move your cursor to a commit
2. Press `E` to **edit** that change — your working copy switches to it
3. Make your modifications (they're automatically captured)
4. Press `c` then `n` to create a new change when done, or `E` on another commit to jump elsewhere

Press `D` on any commit to edit its description without switching to it.

Use `[c` and `]c` to scroll through a commit's diff in a side panel without leaving the status buffer.

## Workspace Support

Neojj includes full support for jj workspaces via the `w` popup:

- **Add** (`a`) / **Add at revision** (`A`) — create a new workspace at a chosen path (defaults to parent of repo root)
- **Quick add** (`q`) / **Quick add at revision** (`Q`) — instantly create a workspace with a random name under a configurable worktrees directory (default `~/.worktrees`)
- **Forget** (`f`) — stop tracking a workspace (files stay on disk)
- **Delete** (`d`) — forget and remove the workspace directory
- **Rename** (`r`) — rename the current workspace
- **List** (`l`) — list all workspaces with paths
- **Update stale** (`u`) — recover a stale workspace

Configure hooks to automatically open new workspaces:

```lua
neojj.setup {
  -- Open a new tmux window in the workspace directory
  workspace_open_command = "tmux new-window -c {path}",
  -- Run a command in the workspace before opening (e.g., install deps)
  workspace_initialize_command = nil,
  -- Base directory for quick-add worktrees
  workspace_worktrees_directory = "~/.worktrees",
}
```

## Highlight Groups

See the built-in documentation for a comprehensive list of highlight groups. If your theme doesn't style a particular group, we'll try our best to do a nice job.

## Acknowledgements

Neojj is a hard fork of [Neogit](https://github.com/NeogitOrg/neogit). Thanks to the Neogit contributors for building the foundation this project is based on. This would not be possible without their work, and I personally use Neogit religiously for all things git.
